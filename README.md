# Java Refresher
Repro: java-refresher  
Repository for first session of COM673, focusing on Java refresher for the upcoming Java on Azure content

## Introduction
In this module the focus will be on designing, developing, debugging and deploying Java apps and bots on the Azure cloud.  
Let's start with a Java refresher. We'll be using Java 10, so some of the latest language features may be new to you.

Java is an OOP language and that we need to be comfortable working with *classes* which define the structure and capabilities of something we want to use and *objects*, which are an instance of a class.  
```java
Dog roscoe = new Dog();
```
In this example, the class is **Dog** and the object is **roscoe**, a particular instance of a dog.
